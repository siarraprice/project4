					<h2>My Adoption Story</h2>
					<p>I am a Great Pyrenees-Australian Shepard mix who lives in Highland, Illinois with my humans. They rescued me from Fayette County Animal Shelter. Myself along with my brothers and sisters were abandoned on the side of a country road, in a box in the ditch. Some kind strangers picked us up and brought us to get help at a local animal shelter. Some of my brothers and sisters were really sick with a bad puppy-sickness called Parvo. Here, at the shelter, we were nursed back to health and put up for adoption. </p>

					<p>I first met my human momma when she visited the shelter, in June 2016. She had just graduated from college and had always wanted a puppy. When I saw her, I crawled onto her lap hoping she would pick me! Thankfully, she did!</p>

					<p>My human parents finally got to officially adopt me in July. I got to come home on my human dad's birthday! What a fun birthday for him - I was the best present ever! They decided to name me June for a few reasons -- they first met me in June, their anniversary is in June, and they are obsessed with Johnny Cash and June Carter. Thus, I was named June Carter Brinker and offiically became the luckiest pup on the planet!</p>

							<p>This is my best puppy pal, Macie. She is my human grandma's pupper. After me and my human momma moved into a new house, grandma got sad that I wasn't there anymore. So she adopted Macie! Macie is a purebred Great Pyrenees. We love to play, but sometimes we fight over bones.</p>
